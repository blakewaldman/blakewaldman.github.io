    <h1>💫 About Me:</h1>
    <p>I'm a senior at Case Western Reserve University, majoring in Finance and Data Science, with a minor in Economics. <p>
    Upon graduation, I'll be attending the University of Michigan to pursue a Master of Business Analytics (MBAn). My passion lies in blending finance and data science to make data-driven decisions.
    </p>As a teaching assistant in Statistics for Business and Management, I have led weekly sessions on topics like probability, graphing, data analysis, and hypothesis testing. As the Technology Vertical Head at The Weatherhead Fund, I've managed a significant portion of our portfolio, creating financial models to inform buy-hold-sell recommendations. Additionally, I have experience in leadership roles within my two fraternities, Alpha Kappa Psi and Zeta Beta Tau.
    </p>My skillset includes programming languages such as Java, Python, R, SQL, and Javascript. I am familiar with a variety of technical tools, including Google Suite, Microsoft Office, SPSS, NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra), and XML. In my free time, I enjoy fishing, baking, and playing racket sports.</p>
