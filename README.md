# üí´ About Me:
I am a recent graduate from Case Western Reserve University, where I majored in Finance and Data Science with a minor in Economics. My passion for blending finance and data science to make data-driven decisions has led me to continue my education. I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

During my undergraduate studies at Case Western, I served as a teaching assistant in Statistics for Business and Management. My responsibilities included leading weekly sessions on topics such as probability, graphing, data analysis, and hypothesis testing. I also held a leadership role as the Technology Vertical Head at The Weatherhead Fund. Here, I was entrusted with the management of a significant portion of our portfolio. My duties involved creating financial models to guide our buy-hold-sell recommendations.

Apart from this, I held leadership positions within two fraternities, Alpha Kappa Psi and Zeta Beta Tau. These experiences allowed me to develop and hone my skills in team management, problem-solving, and strategic planning.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in several programming languages including Java, Python, R, SQL, and Javascript. I also have experience using technical tools such as Google Suite, Microsoft Office, SPSS, NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra, and XML.

Outside of academics and professional pursuits, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. Fishing and baking offer me a chance to unwind and relax, while playing racket sports allows me to stay physically active and competitive.

Looking forward, I am excited about the opportunities to further develop my analytical abilities and to leverage the power of data in driving business decisions.
